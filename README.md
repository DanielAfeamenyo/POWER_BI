# Power_BI Project
The dataset contains data of a pizza delivery service in London, delivering pizzas to three 
areas. Every record defines one order/delivery and the according properties. A pizza is 
supposed to taste good, if its temperature is high enough, say 45 Celsius. So it might be 
interesting for the pizza delivery service to minimize the delivery time

dataset: A data frame with 1209 observations on the following 16 variables.

# Pizza Delivery Dashboard
## Description:

Developed an interactive pizza delivery performance dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize the pizza delivery dataset. The dashboard provides insights into the best and worst delivery days by revenue, area distribution by total deliveries, and driver performance.

## Key responsibilities and achievements:

Extracted data from Excel spreadsheets, and performed data cleaning and transformation using the Power Query Editor.
Developed visually appealing and intuitive dashboards with interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-down functionality to facilitate exploration and analysis by end-users.
Implemented advanced DAX calculations to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, average price per pizza, average delivery time, and wrong pizzas delivered

## Tools Used: 
Power BI, Power Query Editor, DAX, Excel 

## Results: 
The Pizzas delivery dashboard provided actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making for businesses and entrepreneurs alike.
